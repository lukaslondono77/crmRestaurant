Respect repository architecture before suggesting changes.
Never rewrite working code unless asked.
Prefer modifying existing modules over creating new ones.
No new dependencies without justification.
Assume production deployment (Docker, .env).
Follow backend/src patterns for routes and services.
Use SQLite; do not suggest switching databases.
